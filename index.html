    <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    <p>I had my wife take a look at my website. She was amazed that I was able to create a website however she thought it looked rather basic and unfinished. She mentioned that the type was very small and that I should pick a more interesting font. She also pointed out that the still image at the bottom at the homepage was pointless. I agreed and decided to throw in a slide show. I also changed the font and added a back to top button which proved useful on the FAQ page. Lastly, I highlighted each question on the FAQ page and changed up the nav buttons.

    <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
    <p>When I first started this class I was pretty intimidated and to be honest it still feels intimidating. I think it mostly went well. I feel like I have an overall grasp on how coding works and what it's supposed to do. I know that learning how to manage a file system can be difficult but I think I've done a pretty good job. Learning HTML5 also went well. Still so much to learn but I think have a foothold atleast. <p>As far as the not-so-wells go, CSS was very challenging. I honestly got pretty lost, especially when it came to selectors. I muddled my way through the css diner and flexbox froggy. For a while I was trying to follow along in my codespace but I thought I was missing key points, so I eventually just took my hands off my laptop and tried to soak it in. Lots of things flew over my head.</p><p>There are tons of things I would do differently if I could start over. Obviously I would have worked way more outside of class. I wish I would have taken notes and asked more questions in class. It did feel like most of the students in my class had a leg up on web design so I was much more hesitant to speak out. With that being said, I definitley know more about web development than I did before but over the summer I'm absolutly going to look over all the resources that were provided and try to be more prepared for next semester. Overall this was a very fun and interesting course and I'm looking forward to fall. Thanks-Samuel </p>  </p>

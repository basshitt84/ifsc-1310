    <h2>A Brief History of Amasa Hines</h2>
    <p>Amasa Hines is a five piece rock band based in <strong>Little Rock, AR.</strong> Formed in 2013, their influences span a diverse spectrum from Soul to Indie Rock. The tight-knit group skillfully shapes their songs from homages, snapshots, skeletons and obsessions. Their lush, 
        dynamic arrangements provide the platform for lyrical content sourced from 
        observing intimate relationships, nature, and the perceived divine. The band sites TV On The Radio, Spoon, Shabazz Palaces and Radiohead as influences, among other.</p>
